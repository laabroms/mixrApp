# mixrApp

This app is a React Native project using Firebase for authentication, database, and storage.  


Using React Navigation, proper routing is done.  

Additionally, dark mode can be toggled in the drawer navigator once logged in.

A logged in token is generated once a user logs in or creates an account, so the logged in state is saved and passed to all pages when re-rendered.
